### Hi there, I'm Curtis Mayberry ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analog, mixed-signal, RF, and software design engineer.

- ðŸ¦¾ Iâ€™m currently working on automating the design of RF, analog, and
mixed-signal Integrated circuits
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m starting the [cascode-labs](https://github.com/cascode-labs)
organization to support open source analog and RF IC design automation projects
- ðŸ”­ Projects
  - [Virtue](https://www.cascode-labs.org/virtue/): A SKILL and Python Framework for automating IC design in
[Cadence Virtuoso](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/custom-ic-analog-rf-design/circuit-design.html)
  - [Softworks](https://github.com/cascode-labs/softworks):
    Software and documentation view types in the Cadence Virtuoso IC design environment.
  - [Data-panels](https://github.com/cascode-labs/data-panels):
    Export rich data reports from simulation results to pptx slides and
    xlsx tables
  - [Morpheus](https://github.com/cascode-labs/morpheus):
    Generate Maestro test benches in a standard way compatible with an associated
    data-panels report
  - [Viper](https://www.cascode-labs.org/viper/): Integrated circuit design environment supporting both free and commercial tools.
  - [Viper-forge](https://www.cascode-labs.org/viper-forge/): Community-led packages for IC design
- ðŸ’¼ I work at [Skyworks](https://github.com/skyworksinc) as a design engineer
working on SOI switch and CMOS PA controller development for cell phone RF frontends
- âœ¨Interested in working on cutting edge automated IC design? I'm
developing a great engineering team and we're always looking to hire remarkable candidates
